Decades of research and advancements in blockchain led to the development of Non-Fungible Tokens ({NFTs}), which are tokens that represent digital assets and have proof of ownership embedded. The novel characteristic of each token being unique and distinctive from another has strengthened the security of assets and reinforced unique ownership. This cutting-edge technology continues to grow and capture the attention of the masses as more applications of {NFTs} are identified with time. This research aims to present a comprehensive overview of {NFT} and its underlying core technologies, namely blockchain and Ethereum. Further, numerous platforms for buying and selling {NFTs} are presented along with the applications of {NFTs} across various sectors including education, fashion, sports, and digital art.

	abstract = {Abstract
            With the explosive development of decentralized finance, we witness a phenomenal growth in tokenization of all kinds of assets, including equity, funds, debt, and real estate. By taking advantage of blockchain technology, digital assets are broadly grouped into fungible and non-fungible tokens ({NFT}). Here non-fungible tokens refer to those with unique and non-substitutable properties. {NFT} has widely attracted attention, and its protocols, standards, and applications are developing exponentially. It has been successfully applied to digital fantasy artwork, games, collectibles, etc. However, there is a lack of research in utilizing {NFT} in issues such as Intellectual Property. Applying for a patent and trademark is not only a time-consuming and lengthy process but also costly. {NFT} has considerable potential in the intellectual property domain. It can promote transparency and liquidity and open the market to innovators who aim to commercialize their inventions efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to examine the requirements of presenting intellectual property assets, specifically patents, as {NFTs}. Hence, we offer a layered conceptual {NFT}-based patent framework. Furthermore, a series of open challenges about {NFT}-based patents and the possible future directions are highlighted. The proposed framework provides fundamental elements and guidance for businesses in taking advantage of {NFTs} in real-world problems such as grant patents, funding, biotechnology, and so forth.},

At the minimum, a {NFT} is expected to guarantee ownership and control over the tokenised asset. However, information stored on a third party data store may be copied and stolen. We propose a solution to give control back to the information owner by storing encrypted content on the data store and providing additional security against hacks and zero day exploits. The content on our data store is never decrypted or returned to its owner for decryption during rekeying. Also, the key size in our protocol does not increase with each rekeying. With this, we reduce the synchronisation steps and maintain a bounded key size.},

	abstract = {The Non-Fungible Token ({NFT}) market is mushrooming in recent years. The concept of {NFT} originally comes from a token standard of Ethereum, aiming to distinguish each token with distinguishable signs. This type of token can be bound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identiﬁcations. With {NFTs}, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the prosperity of the decentralized application ({DApp}) market. At the time of writing (May 2021), the total money used on completed {NFT} sales has reached 34, 530, 649.86 {USD}. The thousandfold return on its increasing market draws huge attention worldwide. However, the development of the {NFT} ecosystem is still in its early stage, and the technologies of {NFTs} are pre-mature. Newcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to the lack of systematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the {NFT} ecosystems in several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art {NFT} solutions, then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and desired proprieties. Afterwards, we give a security evolution, with discussions on the perspectives of their design models, opportunities and challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic study on the current {NFT} ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In recent years, interest in Non Fungible Tokens ({NFTs}) has soared and the {NFT} market has experienced signiﬁcant growth. Built upon blockchain technology, the tokens represent a unique oﬀering, a rarity, due to its attributes of immutability, trust, transparency, auditability and anonymity. These unique tokens are highly appealing and sought after by investors and traders, since ownership rights, provenance and authenticity are publicly available. As a result, {NFTs} can be applied in a wide range of contexts and sectors. One such sector is in the digital art market, where sales of {NFTs} skyrocketed during 2021, thereby generating a multibillion dollar ecosystem. However, due to the fastchanging evolution of {NFTs}, the increase in demand for the tokens, high returns and lack of regulation, fraud has become commonplace and many security issues have arisen in the ecosystem. In this paper, we explore some of these security issues. Furthermore, by investigating Interplanetary File System ({IPFS}) and hashing techniques, namely cryptographic and perceptual image hashing, in more detail, proof of concept ({PoC}) models were built to aid in the identiﬁcation and combat of {NFT} fraud.},

However, {NFTs} according to current standards have no provisions for the copyright traceability of the off-chain data, which greatly hinders the sustainability of the {NFT} community. In this paper, we propose a new {NFT} model, which is a synergy of a new economic mechanism backed by game theory and two supplementary algorithms to handle the off-chain data. The economic mechanism is ﬁrst proposed to motivate participants to maintain the offchain raw data. Then, the model includes two supplementary algorithms, the version algorithm and validation algorithm, to verify the {NFT}’s ownership and copyright. We implement our model in Solidity on Ethereum and conduct experiments based on the real-world dataset from the largest {NFT} marketplace {OpenSea}. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model is a promising attempt towards the copyright traceability of the offchain data for {NFTs}.},

Although {NFTs} in their current format were ﬁrst invented in 2017 as a means for game players to trade virtual goods, they reached the mainstream in 2021, when the auction house Christie’s held their ﬁrst-ever sale exclusively for an {NFT} of a digital image, that was eventually sold for a record 69 million {USD}. The potential of {NFTs} to generate signiﬁcant revenue for artists and museums by selling effectively a cryptographically signed copy of a digital image (similar to real-world limited editions, which are signed and numbered copies of a given artwork), has sparked the interest of the ﬁnancially deprived museum and heritage sector with world-renowned institutions such as the Ufﬁzi Gallery and the Hermitage Museum, having already employed {NFTs} in order to raise funds. Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of blockchain technology and the rise of malicious projects, exploiting previously digitised heritage content made available through {OpenGLAM} licensing, have attracted criticism over the speculative use of the technology. In this paper, we present the current state of affairs in relation to {NFTs} and the cultural heritage sector, identifying challenges, whilst highlighting opportunities that they create for revenue generation, in order to help address the ever-increasing ﬁnancial challenges of galleries and museums.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Non-Fungible Token ({NFT}) market, various types of digital artwork are published via {NFT} in recent years for sale. In the current {NFT} system, owner’s address of each {NFT} is stored in plaintext. This leads to a severe privacy problem: once a person’s blockchain address is known, all his {NFT} assets are viewable, which may further cause problems related to the privacy of holding sensitive {NFT} or premeditated scams to high-value {NFT} owners. However, due to the limitation of Ethereum and smart contract, it is hard to prevent others from tracking the owner of {NFT}. Meanwhile, current stateof-the-art {NFT} research usually assumes the relation between blockchain address and owner’s identity is unknown, thus creating the so-called anonymity. In this paper, based on the most popular {NFT} marketplace {OpenSea}’s system, we propose a new exchange scheme to hides the address of {NFT} owner during trading. To achieve our goal, a proof of commitment scheme is exploited to bind the owner to an {NFT} while hiding the identity. Moreover, An anonymous payment method is designed to prevent attackers from tracing the Ether ﬂow in {NFT} trading. Our scheme is proven to be secure against curious users and malicious active attackers. Implementation on testnet also shows that the increased gas cost is acceptable, meaning it is suitable for application.},

	abstract = {Uniswap is currently the most liquid Decentralized Exchange ({DEX}) on Ethereum. In May 2021, it upgraded to the third protocol version named Uniswap V3. The key feature update is “concentrated liquidity”, which supports liquidity provision within custom price ranges. However, this design introduces a new type of Miner Extractable Value ({MEV}) source called Justin-Time ({JIT}) liquidity attack, where the adversary mints and burns a liquidity position right before and after a sizable swap. We begin by formally defining the {JIT} liquidity attack and subsequently conduct empirical measurements on Ethereum. Over a span of 20 months, we identify 36,671 such attacks, which have collectively generated profits of 7,498 {ETH}. Our analysis suggests that the {JIT} liquidity attack essentially represents a whales’ game, predominantly controlled by a select few bots. The most active bot, identified as 0xa57...6CF, has managed to amass 92\% of the total profit. Furthermore, we find that this attack strategy poses significant entry barriers, as it necessitates adversaries to provide liquidity that is, on average, 269 times greater than the swap volume. In addition, our findings reveal that the {JIT} liquidity attack exhibits relatively poor profitability, with an average Return On Investment ({ROI}) of merely 0.007\%. We also find this type of attack to be detrimental to existing Liquidity Providers ({LPs}) within the pool, as their shares of liquidity undergo an average dilution of 85\%. On the contrary, this attack proves advantageous for liquidity takers, who secure execution prices that are, on average, 0.139\% better than before. We further dissect the behaviors of the top {MEV} bots and evaluate their strategies through local simulation. Our observations reveal that the most active bot, 0xa57...6CF, conducted 27\% of non-optimal attacks, thereby failing to capture at least 7,766 {ETH} (equivalent to 16.1M {USD}) of the potential attack profit.},

	abstract = {In the energy transition, there is an urgent need for decreasing overall carbon emis‑sions. Against this background, the purposeful and verifiable tracing of emissions in the energy system is a crucial key element for promoting the deep decarbonization towards a net zero emission economy with a market-based approach. Such an effec‑tive tracing system requires end-to-end information flows that link carbon sources and sinks while keeping end consumers’ and businesses’ sensitive data confidential. In this paper, we illustrate how non-fungible tokens with fractional ownership can help to enable such a system, and how zero-knowledge proofs can address the related privacy issues associated with the fine-granular recording of stakeholders’ emission data. Thus, we contribute to designing a carbon emission tracing system that satisfies verifiability, distinguishability, fractional ownership, and privacy requirements. We implement a proof-of-concept for our approach and discuss its advantages compared to alternative centralized or decentralized architectures that have been proposed in the past. Based on a technical, data privacy, and economic analysis, we conclude that our approach is a more suitable technical backbone for end-to-end digital carbon emission tracing than previously suggested solutions.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency miners have great latitude in deciding which transactions they accept, including their own, and the order in which they accept them. Ethereum miners in particular use this flexibility to collect {MEV}—Miner Extractable Value—by structuring transactions to extract additional revenue. Ethereum also contains numerous bots that attempt to obtain {MEV} based on public-but-not-yet-confirmed transactions. Private relays shelter operations from these selfsame bots by directly submitting transactions to mining pools. In this work, we develop an algorithm to detect {MEV} exploitation present in previously mined blocks. We use our implementation of the detector to analyze {MEV} usage and profit redistribution, finding that miners make the lion’s share of the profits, rather than independent users of the private relays. More specifically, (i) 73\% of private transactions hide trading activity or re-distribute miner rewards, and 87.6\% of {MEV} collection is accomplished with privately submitted transactions, (ii) our algorithm finds more than \$6M worth of {MEV} profit in a period of 12 days, two thirds of which go directly to miners, and (iii) {MEV} represents 9.2\% of miners’ profit from transaction fees.},

Reapplying Benford’s Law to a subset of 50 highly popular {NFTs}’ trading volumes, we observe adherence in first and second digits. To ensure robustness, we re-apply a χ2 test and the Mean Absolute Deviation statistic and notice that the principal findings accord with contemporary research on cryptocurrencies and certain asset classes in the traditional financial markets.

	abstract = {The nonfungible token ({NFT}) marketplace spiked in the recent past. The concept originated initially as a token standard of Ethereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, where each token is char­ acterized by distinguishable signs. These types of tokens have unique digital properties that allow their distinct identification. {NFTs}, with their distinct qualities, can be fluidly traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, and liquidity. The trading of {NFTs} has heavily influenced the growth of the decentralized application ({dApp}) marketplace, as exponential returns (thousand folds from their original value) on its ever-expanding market are being observed, leading to worldwide attention. However, the {NFT} ecosystem is in its nascence, and the associated technologies are still in their infancy. New researchers might be fascinated with the expo­ nential, yet nebulous evolution of {NFTs}; however, this novelty has contributed to the paucity of systematic and conclusive published research work on this topic. This review portrays the {NFT} ecosystem multidimensionally, wherein the paper commences with an overview of state-of-the-art {NFT} technology and furnishes summary standards and desired properties. Finally, the study concludes with an elaborate discussion of the future outlook for and prime challenges faced by {NFTs}.},

To address these problems, we aim at automatically ﬂagging blockchain accounts that originate such malicious exploitation of accounts of other participants. To that end, we identify a robust supervised machine learning ({ML}) algorithm that is resistant to any bias induced by an over representation of certain malicious activity in the available dataset, as well as is robust against adversarial attacks. We ﬁnd that most of the malicious activities reported thus far, for example, in Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, behaves statistically similar. Further, the previously used {ML} algorithms for identifying malicious accounts show bias towards a particular malicious activity which is over-represented. In the sequel, we identify that Neural Networks ({NN}) holds up the best in the face of such bias inducing dataset at the same time being robust against certain adversarial attacks.},

	abstract = {Today, online crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk, {UpWork}, and Yahoo! Answers are gaining in popularity. For such online services, it is important to attract “workers” to provide high-quality solutions to the “tasks” outsourced by “requesters.” The challenge is that workers have different skill sets and can provide different amounts of effort. In this article, we design a class of incentive and reputation mechanisms to solicit high-quality solutions from workers. Our incentive mechanism allows multiple workers to solve a task, splits the reward among workers based on requester evaluations of the solution quality, and guarantees that high-skilled workers provide high-quality solutions. However, our incentive mechanism suffers the potential risk that a requester will eventually collects low-quality solutions due to fundamental limitations in task assigning accuracy. Our reputation mechanism ensures that low-skilled workers do not provide low-quality solutions by tracking workers’ historical contributions and penalizing those workers having poor reputations. We show that by coupling our reputation mechanism with our incentive mechanism, a requester can collect at least one high-quality solution. We present an optimization framework to select parameters for our reputation mechanism. We show that there is a trade-off between system efficiency (i.e., the number of tasks that can be solved for a given reward) and revenue (i.e., the amount of transaction fees), and we present the optimal trade-off curve between system efficiency and revenue. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our mechanisms through experiments using a real-world dataset from {UpWork}. We infer model parameters from this data, use them to determine proper rewards, and select the parameters of our incentive and reputation mechanisms for {UpWork}. Experimental results show that our incentive and reputation mechanisms achieve 98.82\% of the maximum system efficiency while only sacrificing 4\% of revenue.},

	title = {Deterrence in the Twenty- First Century},
	abstract = {The evidence in support of the deterrent effect of the certainty of punishment is far more consistent than that for the severity of punishment. However, the evidence in support of certainty’s effect pertains almost exclusively to apprehension probability. Consequently, the more precise statement is that certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing legal consequence, is the more effective deterrent. This conclusion has important policy implications among which are that lengthy prison sentences and mandatory minimum sentencing cannot be justiﬁed on deterrence. There are four major research gaps. The ﬁrst concerns the mechanism by which police affect perceptions of the probability of apprehension. The second concerns the inextricable link between the deterrent effect of the threat of punishment and the potentially criminogenic effect of the experience of punishment. The third concerns the concept of a sanction regime deﬁned by the sanctions legally available and how that legal authority is administered. Theories of deterrence conceive of sanctions in the singular, not the plural, and do not provide a conceptual basis for considering the differential deterrent effects of different components of the sanction regime. The fourth involves sanction risk perceptions. Establishing the link between risk perceptions and sanction regimes is imperative; unless perceptions adjust, however crudely, to changes in the sanction regime, desired deterrent effects will not be achieved.},

Despite its widespread use as a login method by numerous Web3 applications, the security risks of Web3 authentication have not received much attention. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities in the Web3 authentication process and proposes a new type of attack, dubbed blind message attacks. In blind message attacks, attackers trick users into blindly signing messages from target applications by exploiting users’ inability to verify the source of messages, thereby achieving unauthorized access to the target application. We have developed Web3AuthChecker, a dynamic detection tool that interacts with Web3 authentication-related {APIs} to identify vulnerabilities. Our evaluation of real-world Web3 applications shows that a staggering 75.8\% (22/29) of Web3 authentication deployments are at risk of blind message attacks. In response to this alarming situation, we implemented Web3AuthGuard on the open-source wallet {MetaMask} to alert users of potential attacks. Our evaluation results show that Web3AuthGuard can successfully raise alerts in 80\% of the tested Web3 authentications. We have responsibly reported our findings to vulnerable websites and have been assigned two {CVE} {IDs}.},

	abstract = {Persistent digital identities allow individuals to prove who they are across the Internet. For decades, individuals have relied on large identity providers (for example, Google and Facebook). In recent years, the advent of so-called self-sovereign identities ({SSI}) has increasingly been approved by national governments. This decentralized approach provides users with a way to maintain control over the information associated with their identities. Yet, the design of these wallets to enable users to act in a privacy-preserving manner when sharing data with requesting services remains an open question. Based on a qualitative pre-study, we chart the design space for privacy-preserving user interfaces for {SSI} wallets and explore several designs to understand user adoption and decision-making processes. A qualitative user study (N=16) based on realistic scenarios revealed that while the proposed designs generally increase privacy awareness, participants trade data for convenience. Our study is complemented by guidelines for designers of future user interfaces for smartphone {SSI} wallets.},

	abstract = {Information asymmetry between buyers and sellers is often credited as the primary cause of speculation in trading markets. The advent of blockchain technology, which enables full transparency and equal access to trading information for all trading partners, is expected to eliminate information asymmetry in theory and thus eradicate speculation. However, in reality, speculation remains rampant on blockchain-empowered trading markets such as the {NFT} market. We argue that this arises because of the limited attention of individuals to blockchain information. Although easily accessible public trading information could reduce information asymmetry, private information on the assets held by traders may still result in substantial information asymmetry. This is confirmed in our empirical investigation on {CryptoKitties}. We show that information asymmetry still persists in the {NFT} market, which creates opportunities for speculation, with the level of speculation being moderated by {NFT} rarity and user preference. The findings have direct implications for {NFT} platforms to improve operational performance in terms of regulating speculation. At a broader level, this study highlights a fundamental problem: the use of {IT} alone, such as blockchain, may not be adequate to resolve operations inefficiencies, as evidenced by the prevalence of {NFT} speculations.},

Based on the size of held {NFT} values, we classify {NFT} traders into three groups (whales, dolphins, and minnows). In total, we analyze 430K traders from 91 different {NFT} collection sources. We find that the top 0.1\% of {NFT} traders (i.e., whales) drive the {NFT} market with consistent, high returns. We then identify and characterize the {NFT} whales’ unique investment strategies (e.g., mint/sale patterns, wash trading) to empirically understand the whales in the {NFT} market for the first time.},

	abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens ({NFTs}) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, {NFTs} are gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of {NFT}, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the {NFT} marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the {NFT} space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 {NFT}-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders’ concerns in the {NFT} space. We then interviewed 15 {NFT} stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights of these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit {NFTs}, hacking, and unethical {NFTs}. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the {NFT} market and thought about the future of {NFT} and decentralization.},

Since this can impact brand’s image and often, product counterfeits are of a minor quality which can be dangerous and even pose health hazards. Counterfeiters gain profits by manufacturing products using lesser quality materials and production methods. Many counterfeit products in the market are difficult to identify for a normal customer and require to be examined by a trained professional which is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying counterfeit by a simple scan of the quick response code on the product. Since these codes are unique and are implemented by unique algorithms, it is almost impossible to forge them. Also, implementing an encrypted peer-to-peer system for the database makes it impossible for attackers to tamper with the database. The proposed method collectively not only helps laypersons to identify the authenticity of products but also an ownership tracking system where products are linked to the owners’ account which will allow them to produce proof of purchase and authenticity when reselling products and when claiming the warranty of the product. This will help in reducing manufacturing and materials costs used from traditional methods against counterfeiting such as Radio-Frequency Identification and the Hologram technique.},

I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

	abstract = {The smart contract-based markets for non-fungible tokens ({NFTs}) on the Ethereum blockchain have seen tremendous growth in 2021, with trading volumes peaking at \$3.5b in September 2021. This dramatic surge has led to industry observers questioning the authenticity of on-chain volumes, given the absence of identity requirements and the ease with which agents can control multiple addresses. We examine potentially illicit trading patterns in the {NFT} markets from January 2018 to mid-November 2021, gathering data from the 52 largest collections by volume. Our ﬁndings indicate that within our sample 3.93\% of addresses, processing a total of 2.04\% of sale transactions, trigger suspicions of market abuse. Flagged transactions contaminate nearly all collections and may have inﬂated the authentic trading volumes by as much as \$149,5m for the period. Most ﬂagged transaction patterns alternate between a few addresses, indicating a predisposition for manual trading. We submit that the results presented here may serve as a viable lower bound estimate for {NFT} wash trading on Ethereum. Even so, we argue that wash trading may be less common than what industry observers have previously estimated. We contribute to the emerging discourse on the identiﬁcation and deterrence of market abuse in the cryptocurrency markets.},

	abstract = {Ethereum 2.0, as the preeminent smart contract blockchain platform, guarantees the precise execution of applications without third-party intervention. At its core, this system leverages the Proof-of-Stake ({PoS}) consensus mechanism, which utilizes a stochastic process to select validators for block proposal and validation, consequently rewarding them for their contributions. However, the implementation of blockchain technology often diverges from its central tenet of decentralized consensus, presenting significant analytical challenges. Our study collects consensus reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain and conducts a comprehensive analysis of reward distribution and evolution, categorizing them into attestation, proposer and sync committee rewards. To evaluate the degree of decentralization in {PoS} Ethereum, we apply several inequality indices, including the Shannon entropy, the Gini Index, the Nakamoto Coefficient, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ({HHI}). Our comprehensive dataset is publicly available on Harvard Dataverse, and our analytical methodologies are accessible via {GitHub}, promoting open-access research. Additionally, we provide insights on utilizing our data for future investigations focused on assessing, augmenting, and refining the decentralization, security, and efficiency of blockchain systems.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the economic and security implications of Proof-of-Stake ({POS}) designs, providing a survey of {POS} design choices and their underlying economic principles in prominent {POS}-blockchains. The paper argues that {POS}-blockchains are essentially platforms that connect three groups of agents: users, validators, and investors. To meet the needs of these groups, blockchains must balance trade-offs between security, user adoption, and investment into the protocol. We focus on the security aspect and identify two different strategies: increasing the quality of validators (static security) vs. increasing the quantity of stakes (dynamic security). We argue that quality comes at the cost of quantity, identifying a trade-off between the two strategies when designing {POS} systems. We test our qualitative findings using panel analysis on collected data. The analysis indicates that enhancing the quality of the validator set through security measures like slashing and minimum staking amounts may decrease dynamic security. Further, the analysis reveals a strategic divergence among blockchains, highlighting the absence of a single, universally optimal staking design solution. The optimal design hinges upon a platform’s specific objectives and its developmental stage. This research compels blockchain developers to meticulously assess the trade-offs outlined in this paper when developing their staking designs.},

A preliminary analysis might suggest that as the amount staked is far less (11x less) than the value secured, the Ethereum blockchain is insecure and “over-leveraged” in a purely cryptoeconomic sense. In this work, we investigate how Ethereum, or, more generally, any {PoS} blockchain can be made secure despite this apparent imbalance. Towards that end, we attempt to formalize a model for analyzing the cryptoeconomic safety of {PoS} blockchain, which separately analyzes the cost-of-corruption, the cost incurred by an attacker, and the profit-from-corruption, the profit gained by an attacker. We derive sharper bounds on profit-from-corruption, as well as new confirmation rules that significantly decrease this upper-bound. We evaluate cost-of-corruption and profit-from-corruption only from the perspective of attacking safety. Finally, we present a new “insurance” mechanism, {STAKESURE}, for allocating the slashed funds in a {PoS} system, that has several highly desirable properties: solving common information problem in existing blockchains, creating a mechanism for provably safe bridging, and providing the first sharp solution for automatically adjusting how much economic security is sufficient in a {PoS} system. Finally, we show that the system satisfies a notion of strong cryptoeconomic safety, which guarantees that no honest transactor ever loses money, and creates a closed system of Karma, which not only ensures that the attacker suffers a loss of funds but also that the harmed parties are sufficiently compensated.},

	abstract = {Currently, Gasper, the implemented consensus protocol of Ethereum, takes between 64 and 95 slots to ﬁnalize blocks. Because of that, a signiﬁcant portion of the chain is susceptible to reorgs. The possibility to capture {MEV} (Maximum Extractable Value) through such reorgs can then disincentivize honestly following the protocol, breaking the desired correspondence of honest and rational behavior. Moreover, the relatively long time to ﬁnality forces users to choose between economic security and faster transaction conﬁrmation. This motivates the study of the so-called single slot ﬁnality protocols: consensus protocols that ﬁnalize a block in each slot and, more importantly, that ﬁnalize the block proposed at a given slot within such slot.},

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of blockchain technology has amplified the spectrum of potential threats to its integrity and security. The ongoing quest to exploit vulnerabilities emphasizes how critical it is to expand on current research initiatives. Thus, using a methodology based on discrete blockchain layers, our survey study aims to broaden the existing body of knowledge by thoroughly discussing both new and known attack vectors inside the blockchain ecosystem. This survey proposes a novel classification of blockchain attacks and an in-depth investigation of blockchain data security. In particular, the paper provides a thorough discussion of the attack techniques and vulnerabilities that are specific to each tier, along with a detailed look at mitigating techniques. We reveal the deep dynamics of these security concerns by closely investigating the fundamental causes of attacks at various blockchain tiers. We clarify mitigation methods for known vulnerabilities and offer new information on recently developed attack vectors. We also discuss the implications of quantum computing in blockchain and the weaknesses in the current technology that can be exploited in the future. Our study advances the field of blockchain security and privacy research while also contributing to our understanding of blockchain vulnerabilities and attacks. This survey paper is a useful tool for readers who want to learn more about the intricacies of blockchain security. It also invites researchers to help strengthen blockchain privacy and security, paving the way for further developments in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.},

Blockchain protocols that lead to no such infraction states are deemed compliant. Armed with this model, we evaluate the compliance of various Proof-of-Work ({PoW}) and Proof-of-Stake ({PoS}) protocol families, under different utility functions and reward schemes, leading to the following results: i) {PoW} and {PoS} protocols exhibit different compliance behavior, depending on the lossiness of the network; ii) {PoS} ledgers can be compliant w.r.t. one realistic infraction (producing conflicting messages) but non-compliant (hence non-equilibria) w.r.t. others (abstaining or an attack we call selfish signing); iii) considering externalities, like exchange rate fluctuations, we quantify the benefit of economic penalties in the context of {PoS} protocols as mitigation for particular infractions that affect protocol security.},

Users may utilise the same technology for different purposes. In particular, the illicit intention is highly possible to lead to social problems. Cryptocurrency and game under the blockchain system is one of the latest ﬁnancial technology that is used for the process of money laundering to change “illegal" status of money to be “legal" and include trading in black markets across international borders. To prevent and cope with troubles in Thailand, the enactment and amendment of law shall be covered criminal activities, however, the currently revised anti-money laundering act of 1999 is not included the main aspects of legal gaps in cryptocurrency transactions and games under the blockchain system. Therefore, if money laundering via crypto transaction is occured within the territory of Thailand, it will be difﬁcult to adjust laws with each legal case. The primary goal of this research paper is to study the U.S. laws and policies at the federal level against money laundering and compare them with Thailand in order to present appropriate legal framework for Thailand. The study of research will be analysed through criminology and economic perspectives on the identity of ﬁnancial crimes. Criminological theory is used to examine the appropriateness of the nature of criminal frames and penalties, as well as, economic theory is used to describe the costs of crime and decisions based on choices.},

We inspected the development of major topics from the forum over eight years (2012-19) to study the evolution of the motivation and challenges faced by {DNM} users. The extracted temporal topic models successfully captured the apparent dynamics of critical events in the crypto world, showing the shift in the {DNM} drug users’ cryptocurrency preferences. Our analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin traceability (made public in 2015) did not have a deterrent eﬀect. This declaration instead acted as an advertisement for {DNMs}. Drug buyers used Bitcoin despite its traceability until Monero became untraceable in 2017 due to its privacy update. The analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency preferences have shifted from Bitcoin to Monero.},

	abstract = {With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and {bloXroute} servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.},

This approach permits any host with valid credentials to publish veriﬁed updates, increasing decentralization and availability of the system as a whole by simplifying compensation and incentivization, even for untrusted hosts running {TEEs}. Decentagram also supports on-chain subscribers where thirdparty contracts receive events immediately: within the same transaction as the published event. The same event will also be delivered to off-chain subscribing applications through an offchain event broker.

Using the theory of evolutionary game combined with the actual situation of China, the evolutionary process simulations of three participants prove that the tripartite subjects can realize a stable state under the specific relationship. Impact investigation results of typical influential factors indicate the following: (1) The behavior of vendors depends on the government’s supervision and consumers’ reporting attitude. Limiting the penalty amount for vendors to 66.7\% of speculative gains can shorten the processing time for vendors to comply with the law. (2) Consumers play a vital role in food safety supervision of the agricultural market. The penalty for consumers should be limited to 1/3 of the reward amount. (3) The government’s incentive-oriented and punishment-inhibited policies can promote blockchain technology in supervision. Punishment-inhibited and key influencing parameters can cooperate in obtaining the maximum regulatory benefits.

This paper explores the transformative potential of blockchain and digital asset currencies in reshaping regulatory compliance frameworks. By leveraging the intrinsic properties of blockchain technology—decentralization, immutability, and transparency—we illustrate how it can serve as a pivotal tool in the identification and prevention of financial crimes, including sanctions evasion and terrorist financing. The research delves into real-world applications and case studies, demonstrating how immutable ledger technology not only enhances the traceability of transactions but also enables the automation of compliance processes through smart contracts. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges and implications of integrating blockchain solutions within existing legal and regulatory frameworks, providing a balanced view of the operational, legal, and privacy concerns. The findings suggest that while blockchain technology presents a promising avenue for enhancing regulatory compliance, its full potential can only be realized through collaborative efforts among regulators, industry stakeholders, and technology providers to address the challenges above.},

	abstract = {Vehicular network applications, such as Local Danger Warnings ({LDW}), have become necessary as they provide services to drivers with warnings and instructions to ensure safe driving. However, before any vehicle reacts to an alert, it is essential to verify its veracity because an incorrect warning misleads other vehicles and causes unnecessary delays and detours in traffic. On the other hand, ignoring an alert or taking too long to verify it can cause accidents. A common way to address this problem is via a reputation system, where the veracity and plausibility of an alert message are assessed based on the reputation of the vehicle that discloses it. This paper describes a decentralized reputation system based on a consortium blockchain and smart contracts called {BRS}4VANETs. This system analyzes the reliability of data generated by a vehicle, detects malicious behavior, and contributes to decision-making. The complete functional architecture of the system, detailing the algorithms, evaluation metrics, communication protocol, and message formats, is described and implemented. Experiments with network and traffic simulators evaluated the risk of a false message attack, the effectiveness of the system and its overheads. The assessment demonstrates the importance of reputation systems and also shows the feasibility of having a decentralized system to store and disseminate reputation information based on blockchain technologies. Finally, the results also demonstrate that {BRS}4VANETs can successfully detect suspicious and malicious vehicles.},

In this sense, Distributed Ledger Technologies ({DLT}) and, among them, Blockchains ({BC}), emerge as an alternative for shifting trust assumptions between users to the protocol that regulates the interaction, fostering trust in distributed systems. Especially reputation management systems have enabled several applications to be revisited as an application running based on an underlying distributed system. Thus, a clear understanding of major properties, threats and vulnerabilities, and challenges of reputation systems based on diﬀerent types of {DLT} and {BC} (i.e., permissioned and permissionless) are key to determine their usefulness and optimization potentials. In this sense, a use case of a {BC}-based reputation system within the context of cooperative network defenses illustrates such beneﬁts and drawbacks of exploiting {DLTs} for reputation systems.},

	abstract = {This article is an attempt to reconcile the requirements of the {EU} General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR}) and anti-money laundering and combat terrorist ﬁnancing ({AML}/{CFT}) instruments used in permissionless ecosystems based on distributed ledger technology ({DLT}). Usually, analysis is focused only on one of these regulations. Covering by this research the interplay between both regulations reveals their incoherencies in relation to permissionless {DLT}. The {GDPR} requirements force permissionless blockchain communities to use anonymization or, at the very least, strong pseudonymization technologies to ensure compliance of data processing with the {GDPR}. At the same time, instruments of global {AML}/{CFT} policy that are presently being implemented in many countries following the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, counteract the anonymity-enhanced technologies built into blockchain protocols. Solutions suggested in this article aim to induce the shaping of permissionless {DLT}-based networks in ways that at the same time would secure the protection of personal data according to the {GDPR} rules, while also addressing the money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing risks created by transactions in anonymous blockchain spaces or those with strong pseudonyms. Searching for new policy instruments is necessary to ensure that governments do not combat the development of all privacy-blockchains so as to enable a high level of privacy protection and {GDPR}-compliant data processing. This article indicates two {AML}/{CFT} tools which may be helpful for shaping privacy-blockchains that can enable the feasibility of such tools. The ﬁrst tool is exceptional government access to transactional data written on non-transparent ledgers, obfuscated by advanced anonymization cryptography. The tool should be optional for networks as long as another effective {AML}/{CFT} measures are accessible for the intermediaries or for the government in relation to a given network. If these other measures are not available and the network does not grant exceptional access, the regulations should allow governments to combat the development of those networks. Effective tools in that scope should target the value of privacy-cryptocurrency, not its users. Such tools could include, as a tool of last resort, state attacks which would undermine the trust of the community in a speciﬁc network.},

	abstract = {Implementing water-saving agriculture is an important measure to alleviate water resource shortage, improve agricultural ecological environment, and achieve sustainable agricultural development. However, both watersaving service companies ({WSSCs}) and farmers often lack the motivation to adopt water-saving practices due to the high implementation costs involved. To overcome this shortcoming, this study aims to design a blockchaindriven incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game theory, in which the government, {WSSCs} and farmers are game subjects and the idea of cooperative incentive for the government is introduced. Through analyzing the complex interactions among various stakeholders and agricultural water-saving incentives, some findings of this study are obtained. Firstly, the usage of blockchain technology ({BT}) in the incentive mechanism for agricultural water-saving is reflected in supervision and additional default costs, which promote the sus­ tainable cooperation among government, {WSSCs} and farmers in varying degrees. Secondly, the additional default costs brought by the usage of {BT} have a deterrent effect on {WSSCs} and farmers, which makes them to actively implement water-saving practices. Thirdly, the additional default cost brought by {BT} has become the main basis for the government to choose {BT} supervision. As the additional default cost increases, the government are not more inclined to use {BT}. It provides valuable insights into motivating diverse stakeholders to actively participate in water-saving practices, promoting sustainable water resources management in agriculture.},

This affects the overall trust and integrity of the network. To address this issue, the current study offers a network model that incorporates the concepts of graph theory and utilizes a matrix representation for reward and trust optimization. Furthermore, this study presents a game-theoretic framework that encourages cooperative conduct and discourages malicious actions, ultimately producing a state of equilibrium according to the Nash equilibrium. The simulations validated the model’s efficacy in addressing fraudulent transactions and emphasized its scalability, security, and fairness benefits. This study makes a valuable contribution to the field of blockchain technology by presenting an incentive model that effectively encourages the development of secure and trusted decentralized systems.},

Specifically, the incentive mechanism is the blockchain’s core value, including positive and negative incentive mechanisms. The former strengthens people’s behaviour positively, while the latter, on the contrary, adopts mandatory methods such as punishment to eliminate the occurrence of certain types of behaviour. The negative incentive mechanism is the key factor to solve the problems presented above that traditional online communities face. Specifically, this article develops a solution that utilises the negative incentive mechanism, based on the classic infectious disease model ({SIR} model), introduces smart nodes, puts forward the {SSIR} model of information dissemination in the blockchain network community, and establishes a set of differential equations reflecting the information dissemination rules. Based on the parameter assumption and solving the equations with {MATLAB}, this article compares and reveals the changes of different user types on the {SIR} and {SSIR} models. Furthermore, we utilise the data collected from the Steemit blockchain community and Sina Weibo platform and apply the Social Network Analysis method to compare and analyse the information dissemination between the blockchain and the traditional network community. The research results highlight that the negative incentive mechanism in the blockchain network community affords a more rational behaviour of user information dissemination, a simpler interaction between users, and reducing to a certain extent the dissemination of ‘distorted’ or ‘uncertain’ information.},

	abstract = {Many advocates of distributed ledger technologies (including blockchain) claim that these technologies provide the foundations for an organisational form that will enable individuals to transact with each other free from the travails of conventional law, thus offering the promise of grassroots democratic governance without the need for third party intermediaries. But does the assumption that blockchain systems will operate beyond the reach of conventional law withstand critical scrutiny? This is the question which this paper investigates, by examining the intersection and interactions between conventional law promulgated and enforced by national legal systems (ie the ‘code of law’) and the internal rules of blockchain systems which take the form of executable software code and cryptographic algorithms via a distributed computing network (‘code as law’). It identifies three ways in which the code of law may interact with code as law, based primarily on the intended motives and purposes of those engaged in activities in developing, maintaining or undertaking transactions upon the network, referring to the use of blockchain: (a) with the express intention of evading the substantive limits of the law (‘hostile evasion’); (b) to complement and/or supplement conventional law with the aim of streamlining or enhancing compliance with agreed standards (‘efficient alignment’); and (c) to co-ordinate the actions of multiple participants via blockchain to avoid the procedural inefficiencies and complexities associated with the legal process, including the transaction, monitoring and agency costs associated with conventional law (‘alleviating transactional friction’). These different classes of case are likely to generate different dynamic interactions between the blockchain code and conventional legal systems, which I describe respectively as ‘cat and mouse’, the ‘joys of (patriarchial) marriage’ and ‘uneasy coexistence and mutual suspicion’ respectively.},

	abstract = {Online Social Networks ({OSNs}) represent today a big communication channel where users spend a lot of time to share personal data. Unfortunately, the big popularity of {OSNs} can be compared with their big privacy issues. Indeed, several recent scandals have demonstrated their vulnerability. Decentralized Online Social Networks ({DOSNs}) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the current centralized {OSNs}. {DOSNs} do not have a service provider that acts as central authority and users have more control over their information. Several {DOSNs} have been proposed during the last years. However, the decentralization of the social services requires eﬃcient distributed solutions for protecting the privacy of users. During the last years the blockchain technology has been applied to Social Networks in order to overcome the privacy issues and to oﬀer a real solution to the privacy issues in a decentralized system. However, in these platforms the blockchain is usually used as a storage, and content are public. In this paper, we propose a manageable and auditable access control framework for {DOSNs} using blockchain technology for the deﬁnition of privacy policies. The resource owner uses the public key of the subject to deﬁne auditable access control policies using Access Control List ({ACL}), while the private key associated with the subject’s Ethereum account is used to decrypt the private data once access permission is validated on the blockchain. We provide an evaluation of our approach by exploiting the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet to deploy the smart contracts. Experimental results clearly show that our proposed {ACL}-based access control outperforms the Attribute-based access control ({ABAC}) in terms of gas cost. Indeed, a simple {ABAC} evaluation function requires 280,000 gas, instead our scheme requires 61,648 gas to evaluate {ACL} rules.},

In this study, we present a novel blockchain-based {PKI} architecture designed to accommodate diverse certificate types. Combining the principles of the Web of Trust with a centralized model, our {SemiDec}-{PKI} establishes a resilient, distributed infrastructure. This unique synergy minimizes reliance on a single central authority, mitigating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional {PKI} systems’ single points of failure. With a cross-check mechanism and collective consensus of trusted entities, {SemiDec}-{PKI} provides higher fault tolerance, preventing disruptions from certificate misissuance or compromised certificate authorities. Furthermore, it introduces a stake-based reward-punishment mechanism which incentives honest behavior and penalizes malicious actions, serving as a potent deterrent against impersonation attacks.},

Our aim is to examine the way blockchain technologies can bring about - and justify - new models of governance. To do so, we draw on the philosophical works of Hobbes, Rousseau, and Rawls, analyzing blockchain governance in terms of contrasting social contract theories. We begin by comparing the justifications of blockchain governance offered by members of the blockchain developers’ community with the justifications of governance presented within social contract theories. We then examine the extent to which the model of governance offered by blockchain technologies reflects key governance themes and assumptions located within social contract theories, focusing on the notions of sovereignty, the initial situation, decentralization and distributive justice.},

	abstract = {Human decision making is often prone to biases and irrationality. Group decisions add dynamic interactions that further complicate the choice process and frequently result in outcomes that are suboptimal for both the individual and the collective. We show that an implementation of a Blockchain protocol improves individuals’ decision strategies and increases the alignment between desires and outcomes. The Blockchain protocol affords (1) a distributed decision, (2) the ability to iterate repeatedly over a choice, (3) the use of feedback and corrective inputs, and (4) the quantiﬁcation of intrinsic choice attributes (i.e., greed, desire for fairness, etc.). We test our protocol’s performance in the context of the Public Goods Game. The game, a generalized version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, allows players to maximize their own gain or act in ways that beneﬁt the collective. Empirical evidence shows that participants’ cooperation in the game typically decreases once a single player favors their own interest at the expense of others’. In our Blockchain implementation, “smart contracts” are used to safeguard individuals against losses and, consequently, encourage contributions to the public good. Across different tested simulations, the Blockchain protocol increases both the overall trust among the participants and their proﬁts. Agents decision strategies remain ﬂexible while they act as each other’s source of accountability (which can be seen as formalized distributed “Ulysses contract”). To highlight the contribution of our protocol to society at large we incorporated an entity that represents the public good. This benevolent independent beneﬁciary of the contributions of all participants (e.g., a charity organization or a tax system) maximized its payoffs when the Blockchain protocol was implemented. We provide a formalized implementation of the Blockchain protocol and discuss potential applications that could beneﬁt society by more accurately capturing individuals’ preferences. For example, the protocol could help maximize proﬁts in groups, facilitate democratic election that better reﬂect the public opinion, or enable group decision in circumstances where a balance between anonymity, diverse opinions, personal preferences and loss-aversion play a role.},

	abstract = {Administrative punishment is one of the most important ways of enforcing administrative law in the ﬁeld of market supervision in China. However, at the current stage, the abuse of data access permission and the difﬁculty in managing timeliness in administrative punishment still remain unresolved, which hinders the legalization and standardization of the administrative punishment system. Inspired by blockchain, which is inherently traceable, tamper-proof, and transparent, we design a system, punishment supervisor ({PEATS}), which is suitable for administrative punishment and technically overcomes the defects of the traditional administrative punishment procedure. To prevent the abuse of data access permission, we innovatively introduce the authorization control gateway ({ACG}) to verify the access permission of users based on the records in the market supervision department ({MSD}) contract. To ensure the timeliness of the administrative punishment procedure, we design a special case contract that has the same status as the general case processing state of administrative punishment to track case progress on the blockchain. We experiment and evaluate {PEATS} in terms of functionality and performance and ﬁnd that {PEATS} provides traceability, transparency, and timeliness assurance. In addition, {PEATS} has 80.9\% of the throughput of a traditional server with no more than an additional 3\% latency and at most 60 {kB} additional storage space per case.},

	abstract = {Internet of Vehicular Things ({IoVT}), as a subset of the Internet of Things ({IoT}), enhances safety, traffic management, and driver experience by connecting vehicles and facilitating data exchange. Indeed, the implementation of {IoVT} comes with its fair share of challenges, which include transparent and secure service management, security, privacy preservation, and prevention of malware attacks. Researchers have proposed reputation-based systems, including blockchain-supported ones, as effective solutions to address the challenges in {IoVT}, offering benefits such as integrity, authenticity, transparency, and privacy preservation support. On the other hand, cryptocurrency offers several advantages, such as decentralization, enhanced security, and lower transaction costs, making it an effective form of payment that can bypass traditional intermediaries and facilitate fast and borderless transactions with greater financial privacy and control for users. In this paper, a blockchain-based reputation management system is proposed that can collect information about the surroundings from intelligent vehicles, convert that data into appropriate information, and make necessary decisions regarding reported incidents. A cryptocurrency-based recovery system allows defaulters to recover their missing points through the use of digital tokens or assets, providing them with a transparent and decentralized mechanism for restoring their lost value or reputation. The proposed method for the cryptocurrency-based recovery system is implemented and tested using virtual machines, specifically utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract programming as proof of concept to showcase the functionality and feasibility of the system. Additionally, the packet structure and the throughput are also demonstrated to prove the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Until now, no blockchain could tolerate an attacker controlling a majority of the system. In this paper, we present Zero-Loss Blockchain ({ZLB}), the first blockchain that tolerates an adversary controlling more than half of the system. {ZLB} is an open blockchain that combines recent theoretical advances in accountable Byzantine agreement to exclude undeniably deceitful replicas. progressively reduces the portion of deceitful replicas below \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}\$, and reaches consensus.

	abstract = {In vehicular social networks ({VSNs}), edge stations or cloud service provider can support the trafﬁc services or location services to vehicles. Moreover, the information sharing among vehicles can assist vehicles to avoid trafﬁc accidents and guarantee driving safety. However, it is easy to be threatened in the communication of vehicle-to-edge station, vehicle-to-cloud service provider and vehicle-to-vehicle in {VSNs}, which leads to the vehicle’s privacy leakage easily. Besides, some malicious users may provide untrustworthy information to mislead others just for its selﬁshness. Hence, in this paper, we propose an efﬁcient, reliable and privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain for {VSNs}. In our scheme, pseudonym mechanism is employed to achieve individual anonymization by concealing the vehicles’ identity. Moreover, to encourage vehicles to report trustworthy information, incentive-punishment mechanism is proposed. Meanwhile, we propose multi-factors and single-factor weightbased evaluation mechanism to evaluate the reliability of message. Additionally, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ({PBFT}) and blockchain are also employed to achieve consensus and store the records respectively, which can prevent malicious entities from manipulating on vehicles’ reward scores and credit scores. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed scheme in terms of external attacks, internal attacks, collusion attacks etc. The relevant experimental results are shown that our scheme is feasible and efﬁcient.},

	abstract = {With the success of Bitcoin, nowadays, both academia and industry have been focusing on the expansion of blockchain in non-cryptocurrency applications to facilitate the development of Industry 4.0. The incentive mechanism in blockchain, which encourages miners to participate in validation processes, is important to the maintenance of the system. However, the techniques, which are widely applied in existing blockchain systems, are not suitable for non-cryptocurrency applications with business models and have become a major issue that undermines the adoption of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a compatible incentive mechanism for noncryptocurrency applications to encourage validators’ actions to align with consensus algorithm. The compatible incentive mechanism works with a consensus algorithm to make the blockchain technology more adaptable in industry applications. The proposed design matches with the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ({PBFT}) consensus algorithm which is adopted by most non-cryptocurrency applications. Game theory-based analysis is conducted to identify the problems caused by participants’ misbehaviours. Meanwhile, a mechanism design based on game theory analysis is adopted to develop our incentive mechanism which satisfies the compatibility requirement. Both mathematical proof and simulation experiments are used to evaluate our mechanism design. The results demonstrate that our compatible incentive mechanism encourages the desired honest behaviour among validators so that the blockchain can be maintained to align with the consensus algorithm.},

This paper argues why these incentive schemes are detrimental to blockchain.

	abstract = {The rationality and scientific nature of the emission trading mechanism is the key to the effective implementation of environmental and economic policies. As far as China is concerned, there are phenomena such as information asymmetry, low supervision efficiency, and alienation of government and enterprise behaviors caused by the incomplete mechanism of emission trading in the practice of different pilots. The introduction of blockchain technology can innovate the traditional transaction model and form a decentralized peer-to-peer transaction and a trusted emission trading market. To this end, based on the current emission trading mechanism and the characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper couples the core technologies of blockchain with the functional requirements of application scenarios. Then, an innovative application framework is built based on the consortium blockchain Fabric from three aspects: emission trading supervision, secondary trading market construction, as well as emission trading incentive and punishment mechanisms. Technologies such as the consensus mechanism, smart contract, Merkle tree and asymmetric encryption are comprehensively applied in this process. In the construction of the blockchain framework of the secondary market for emission trading, institutional changes and innovations brought about by the blockchain at various levels are analyzed in terms of participants, transaction processes and the transaction scope. At the same time, smart contract functions and algorithms are designed for the purchase, transfer-out and trading of emission rights, and the operation business logic of the smart contract is analyzed. On the whole, this paper explores the application framework of blockchain technology in the field of emission trading at the macro level, and analyzes the application mechanism of the corresponding technologies of blockchain at each coupling point in the framework at the micro level. The collaborative analysis at the two levels shows that blockchain technology and the requirements of emission trading mechanism can be effectively coupled, and the application of blockchain technology can promote the effective supervision of enterprises' emission behavior, making the processes of the purchase, transfer and transaction of emission rights intelligent and automated, and providing technical support for crossregional emission trading to reduce transaction costs and management complexity. In addition, the issuance of emission credits based on smart contract will be a new incentive for companies to actively participate in transactions. Based on the above analysis, this paper believes that the innovative application of blockchain technology is of great significance in the promotion of the market-based allocation of element of emission trading and the rational allocation of environmental resources. It will lead to a major breakthrough in the traditional trading system in terms of trading modes, forming a value transmission network of environmental resources between the government and polluters.},

At present, because {IIoT} system is an open, distributed and heterogeneous system, it is a great challenge to implement trusted communication in {IIoT}. Blockchain technology has become a new way to solve the cooperative trust issues of industrial Internet of Things. Using blockchain, a tamper-proof system can be built, which can be used as an audit tool for hardware products of industrial Internet of Things from chip to whole equipment. Blockchain improve productivity and operational efficiency of {IIoT} through smart contract, allowing machines to manage themselves. To apply blockchain technology in {IIoT}, one of the main issues is to solve the security and efficiency problems of consensus protocols. In this paper, a reputation scheme is proposed to encourage normal nodes and abnormal nodes both to participate in network collaboration in a good way. In order to guide the behavior, a credit based incentive approach is proposed. The reward and punishment factor is designed in the revenue payment function of reputation. The effectiveness is that the cooperative behavior is rewarded, and the non cooperative behavior is punished. The main advantage of our scheme is that our reputation based incentive module can be implemented on state-of-the-art {PoX} protocols, which is called {PoRX},and can make {PoX} protocols achieve better consensus states. Therefore, it would benefit the applications of {IIoT} with blockchain. A prototype has been implemented and the experimental results shows that our scheme can effectively encourage the cooperative behavior of the nodes in {IIoT}, that can benefit the network.},

	abstract = {The immersive metaverse environment offers distinct social interactions and opportunities, yet it also presents signiﬁcant challenges in securely managing misbehavior, including hate speech, bullying, and harassment. Existing solutions primarily focus on detecting such behavior through artiﬁcial intelligence but lack robust mechanisms for management and governance. This gap is critical as the metaverse continues to mirror complex real-world interactions and centralized authority systems prove vulnerable to compromise. Our research introduces a novel framework, Meta-Governance, which not only detects but also effectively manages and governs user behavior through smart contracts, ensuring a secure, fair, and transparent metaverse environment. The system incorporates behavior monitoring to identify and condemn inappropriate behavior, speciﬁcally targeting problems such as hate speech and cyberbullying. Occurrences of misbehavior are permanently preserved on the blockchain to ensure the capacity to trace and bear accountability. In this article, we deploy a Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) model and a smart contract-based framework to address unusual behavior monitoring, access control, and credit scoring. Deep learning models are used to identify and classify linguistic patterns that may be considered hazardous. Blockchain technology addresses virtual misconduct using smart contracts, while a distinctive credit scoring mechanism ensures that users are held responsible for making disrespectful statements. The efﬁcacy of the proposed smart contract is comprehensively evaluated within the context of a private Hyperledger Besu system. The integration of {AI} and blockchain may greatly improve the security and inclusiveness of the metaverse, highlighting the crucial role of these technologies in combating hate speech and enhancing user engagement.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has been increasingly used as a software component to enable decentralisation in software architecture for a variety of applications. Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to ensure the safe and appropriate use and evolution of blockchain, especially after the Ethereum {DAO} attack in 2016. However, there are no systematic efforts to analyse existing governance solutions. To understand the state-of-the-art of blockchain governance, we conducted a systematic literature review with 37 primary studies. The extracted data from primary studies are synthesised to answer identiﬁed research questions. The study results reveal several major ﬁndings: 1) governance can improve the adaptability and upgradability of blockchain, whilst the current studies neglect broader ethical responsibilities as the objectives of blockchain governance; 2) governance is along with the development process of a blockchain platform, while ecosystem-level governance process is missing, and; 3) the responsibilities and capabilities of blockchain stakeholders are brieﬂy discussed, whilst the decision rights, accountability, and incentives of blockchain stakeholders are still under studied. We provide actionable guidelines for academia and practitioners to use throughout the lifecycle of blockchain, and identify future trends to support researchers in this area.},

Road transport, as one of the primary sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, has great potential for energy conservation and emission reduction in achieving the climate goals. However, current approaches cannot efficiently reduce road travel, making it challenging to decarbonize in the transport sector. Therefore, in this paper, we propose {STRICTs}, a blockchain-enabled motor vehicle restrictive and trading system based on the carbon emissions cap. {STRICTs} allows automated carbon emission auditing and carbon emission violation punishment without relying on third-party escrow. Through a decentralized enforcer, {STRICTs} also enables carbon permit trading reliably and transparently. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric and conduct experiments for comprehensive performance evaluation through {CO}2 Emission by Vehicles dataset.

	abstract = {The blockchain-based access control mechanism ({BACM}) is gradually becoming an essential paradigm for solving dynamic and trusted access control problems in the open network environment. However, since the current open network environment has such features as dynamic variability and the uncertainty of user identity, most of the existing {BACM} cannot solve the access control problems in the current open network environment in a dynamic, ﬂexible, proactive, efﬁcient, and ﬁne-grained approach. In this paper, we propose a novel {BACM} scheme to address such problems. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst design a new, proactive, and ﬁne-grained access control model, by utilizing the dynamicity and ﬁne-grain of the attribute-based access control model, ﬂexibility shown by the trust evaluation mechanism in evaluating the trust level of users, and proactivity shown by the game evaluation mechanism in curbing malicious users who suddenly launch malicious access requests. Second, based on the above access control model, we propose a dynamic, ﬂexible, and proactive {BACM} for the current open network environment, exploiting the trustworthiness and transparency that the smart contract and the transaction mechanism in blockchain technology show during program execution. Further, a double sliding storage window is built, guaranteeing accurate data acquisition by {BACM} while efﬁciently allowing it to acquire time-sensitive data during the permission management process. Meanwhile, a pre-authorization concept is introduced to improve the efﬁciency and ﬂexibility of {BACM} in processing access control problems. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed {BACM} scheme satisﬁes the simple security issue and the simple availability issue. Experiments on a real user trust record dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed {BACM} scheme in evaluating and deciding on access requests and the superiorities over most existing schemes in dynamicity, ﬁne granularity, ﬂexibility, and proactivity.},

At the same time, empirically, we observe a greater incidence of research misconduct. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the nature and extent of the misconduct problem, to show why it may persist in the absence of conscious remedial action, and to discuss solutions that help lower the likelihood of spurious research escaping undetected. A simple model is constructed to emphasize that there exists the potential for a Prisoners’ Dilemma in academia, where scholars engage in misconduct at equilibrium (the Academic Dilemma). The paper then examines why conventional “centralized” regulatory solutions under the current system are not likely to succeed in resolving the problem, analyzes the properties of a decentralized solution utilizing blockchains, and argues that once incentive structures in academia are factored in, a permissioned blockchain may emerge as an effective middle-ground solution for mitigating scientific misconduct. In doing so, the paper highlights the importance of new technologies and recent advancements in Open Science for battling misconduct, and takes stock of the evolving nature of academic publishing.},

	abstract = {In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.},

	abstract = {As {CryptoPunks} pioneers the innovation of non-fungible tokens ({NFTs}) in {AI} and art, the valuation mechanics of {NFTs} has become a trending topic. Earlier research identifies the impact of ethics and society on the price prediction of {CryptoPunks}. Since the booming year of the {NFT} market in 2021, the discussion of {CryptoPunks} has propagated on social media. Still, existing literature hasn’t considered the social sentiment factors after the historical turning point on {NFT} valuation. In this paper, we study how sentiments in social media, together with gender and skin tone, contribute to {NFT} valuations by an empirical analysis of social media, blockchain, and crypto exchange data. We evidence social sentiments as a significant contributor to the price prediction of {CryptoPunks}. Furthermore, we document structure changes in the valuation mechanics before and after 2021. Although people’s attitudes towards Cryptopunks are primarily positive, our findings reflect imbalances in transaction activities and pricing based on gender and skin tone. Our result is consistent and robust, controlling for the rarity of an {NFT} based on the set of human-readable attributes, including gender and skin tone. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary study at the intersection of {AI}, Ethics, and Society, focusing on the ecosystem of decentralized {AI} or blockchain.

The result of our study clearly indicate that our approach offers more opportunities and beneﬁts to participants by ensuring them permanent, dynamic and proportionate rewards based on their scores and compliance rates.

	abstract = {Recently, increasing personal data has been stored in blockchain databases, ensuring data integrity by consensus. Although transparent and immutable blockchains are mainly adopted, the need to deploy preferences on which users can read and edit the data is growing in importance. Based on chameleon hashes, recent blockchains support editability governance but can hardly prevent data breaches because the data is readable to all participants in plaintexts. This motivates us to propose {NANO}, the ﬁrst permissioned blockchain database that provides downward compatible readability and editability governance (i.e., users who can edit the data can also read the data). Two challenges are protecting policy privacy and efﬁciently revoking malicious users (e.g., users who abuse their editability privileges). The punchline is leveraging Newton’s interpolation formula-based secret sharing to hide policies into polynomial parameters and govern the distribution of data decryption keys and chameleon hash trapdoors. Inspired by proxy re-encryption, {NANO} integrates unique user symbols into user keys, achieving linear user revocation overhead. Security analysis proves that {NANO} provides comprehensive privacy preservation under the chosen-ciphertext attack. Experiments on the {FISCO} blockchain platform demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art related solutions, {NANO} achieves a 7× improvement on average regarding computational costs, gas consumption, and communication overhead.},

However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work, we introduce the concept of unstoppable wallets, which are programmable threshold {ECDSA} wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We propose a new model that encapsulates the use of a confidential smart contract as both a party and the sole (broadcast) communication channel in secure Multi-Party Computation ({MPC}) protocols. We construct highly efficient threshold {ECDSA} protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security under this model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority of signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold {ECDSA} key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead. We implement these protocols as smart contracts, deploy them on Secret Network, and showcase their applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

Traditional methods to defeat equivocation rely on trusted hardware or particular assumptions, which may hinder their adoption in practice. The advent of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies provides an auspicious breakthrough paradigm to resolve the problem above. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution to address contractual equivocation, which supports user-defined fine-grained policybased equivocation. Specifically, users will be de-incentive if the statements they made breach the predefined access rules. The core of our solution is a newly introduced primitive named Policy-Authentication-Preventing Signature ({PoAPS}), which combined with a deposit mechanism allows a signer to make conflict statements corresponding to a policy to be penalized. We present a generic construction of {PoAPS} based on Policy-Based Verifiable Secret Sharing ({PBVSS}) and demonstrate its practicality via a concrete implementation in the blockchain. Compared with the existing solutions that only handle specific types of equivocation, our proposed approach is more generic and can be instantiated to deal with various kinds of equivocation.},

    abstract = {Human genomic data carry unique information about an individual and offer unprecedented opportunities for healthcare. The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, poses major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide a secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this article, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.},

  abstract     = {The non-fungible tokens trading of digital content works, as an emerging business model, has rapidly developed while also posing challenges to current copyright protection. The {NFT} infringement incidents in recent years have exposed many issues, such as lack of government regulation, imperfect copyright protection mechanisms, and illegal proﬁts from service platforms. Considering the collusive behavior during the {NFT} minting process, this study uses evolutionary game theory to model a game composed of three populations: digital content creators; {NFT} service platforms; and government regulatory agencies. We derived and analyzed the replication dynamics of the game to determine the evolutionary stability strategy. In addition, combined with numerical simulations, we also analyzed the impact of individual factors on the stability of system evolution. This study identiﬁes that the incentives and ﬁnes set by the government must be above a certain threshold in order for game results to develop toward an ideal equilibrium state, and the government can try to improve the efﬁciency of obtaining and updating market information and set dynamic punishment and reward mechanisms based on this. This study also found that excessive rewards are not conducive to the government fulﬁlling its own regulatory responsibilities. In this regard, the government can use information technology to reduce the cost of regulation, thereby partially offsetting the costs brought about by incentive mechanisms. In addition, the government can also enhance the governance participation of platforms and creators to improve the robustness of digital copyright protection by strengthening media construction and cultivating public copyright awareness. This study helps to understand the complex relationship between {NFT} service platforms, digital content creators, and government regulatory authorities and proves the practical meaning of countermeasures and suggestions for improving government digital copyright regulations.},

As cryptocurrency evolved, new financial instruments, such as lending and borrowing protocols, currency exchanges, fungible and non-fungible tokens ({NFT}), staking and mining protocols have emerged. A financial ecosystem built on top of a blockchain is supposed to be fair and transparent for each participating actor. Yet, there are sophisticated actors who turn their domain knowledge and market inefficiencies to their strategic advantage; thus extracting value from trades not accessible to others. This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that blockchain-based markets and decentralized finance ({DeFi}) instruments are mostly unregulated. Though a large body of work has already studied the unfairness of different aspects of {DeFi} and cryptocurrency trading, the economic intricacies of non-fungible token ({NFT}) trades necessitate further analysis and academic scrutiny.},

While fungible tokens have enabled new use cases such as Initial Coin Offerings, the potential of {NFTs} as a valuable component remains unclear.

We follow a rigorous design science research approach of designing, building and thoroughly evaluating a prototype of an event ticketing system based on {NFTs}. Thereby, we demonstrate the usefulness of {NFTs} to tokenize digital goods, prevent fraud and improve control over secondary market transactions. Further, we contribute generalizable knowledge of the benefits and challenges of {NFTs} and derive implications for both researchers and practitioners.

  abstract     = {Non-fungible tokens ({NFTs}) are a striking Web 3.0 innovation. Concomitant with their rise, the existence of {NFT} works that constitute copyright infringement has become increasingly commonplace. However, the existing research based on European and American copyright law concerning {NFT} works is very limited. To contribute to the scholarly literature in this field, this article analyzes typical recent cases worldwide, especially the world's first case, in which a final judgment has been rendered in China. The article presents original arguments regarding the core issues of copyright for {NFT} works. Specifically, this article argues that the existence of {NFT} works that constitute copyright infringement systematically impacts the existing copyright order, necessitating the re-examination and reformation of the copyright system based on the theoretical idea of a balance of interests. Regarding the legal nature of minting and trading {NFT} works, this article argues that the authors of {NFT} works have the right to information network dissemination and that the principle of exhaustion of rights is difficult to apply to copyright for {NFT} works. The article also examines the legal status and liabilities of minters of {NFT} works and {NFT} trading platforms. It argues that they should bear heavier legal obligations in avoiding copyright infringement. Remedies for {NFT} copyright infringement involve technical elements.},

  title      = {Assessing the Impact of Sanctions in the Crypto Ecosystem: Effective Measures or Ineffective Deterrents?},
  abstract   = {Regulatory authorities aim to tackle illegal activities by targeting the economic incentives that drive such behaviour. This is typically achieved through the implementation of ﬁnancial sanctions against the entities involved in the crimes. However, the rise of cryptocurrencies has presented new challenges, allowing entities to evade these sanctions and continue criminal operations. Consequently, enforcement measures have been expanded to include crypto assets information of sanctioned entities. Yet, due to the nature of the crypto ecosystem, blocking or freezing these digital assets is harder and, in some cases, such as with Bitcoin, unfeasible. Therefore, sanctions serve merely as deterrents. For this reason, in this study, we aim to assess the impact of these sanctions on entities’ crypto activities, particularly those related to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our objective is to shed light on the validity and eﬀectiveness (or lack thereof) of such countermeasures. Speciﬁcally, we analyse the transactions and the amount of {USD} moved by punished entities that possess crypto addresses after being sanctioned by the authority agency. Results indicate that while sanctions have been eﬀective for half of the examined entities, the others continue to move funds through sanctioned addresses. Furthermore, punished entities demonstrate a preference for utilising rapid exchange services to convert their funds, rather than employing dedicated money laundering services. To the best of our knowledge, this study oﬀers valuable insights into how entities use crypto assets to circumvent sanctions.},

We focus speciﬁcally on Kleros, a blockchain-enabled dispute resolution platform, that promises to secure, authenticate, and democratize access to justice for the twenty-ﬁrst century. We advance the concept of cryptocourts whereby jurors, incentivized by accumulating cryptocurrency, rapidly mobilize using principles of on-demand crowdsourcing to resolve disputes. We critique the broader social imaginaries that cryptocourts such as Kleros will result in a more open, trustworthy, transparent, and democratic systems of justice. These platforms instead pose important questions concerning their potential impact on civil dispute resolution practices by embedding it within an economy of cryptocurrency speculation. This ostensibly results in a legal infrastructure founded on principles of ﬁnancial acquisition that positions jurors as economic agents seeking to proﬁt from disputes, and courts as computational systems that merely authenticate and secure the distribution of evidence and verdicts.},

To automatically determine what safety specifications to check, we retrieve textual semantics from {DApp} user interfaces. To exclude untrusted {UI} text, we also validate the {UI}-logic consistency and detect any discrepancies. We have implemented {VetSC} and applied it to 34 real-world {DApps}. Experiments have demonstrated that {VetSC} can accurately interpret smart contract code, enable autonomous safety vetting, and discover safety risks in real-world Dapps. Using our tool, we have successfully discovered 19 new safety risks in the wild, such as expired lottery tickets and double voting.},

  title        = {Market Responses to Genuine Versus Strategic Generosity: An Empirical Examination of {NFT} Charity Fundraisers},
  issn         = {1556-5068},
  abstract     = {Crypto donations now represent a significant fraction of charitable giving worldwide. Nonfungible token ({NFT}) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of {NFTs} of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of {NFT} charity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased {NFTs}. Questions may arise about the motivations of donors in these charity fundraisers, resulting in a negative social image. {NFT} charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic consequences of a donor’s social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large {NFT} charity fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an {NFT} within the charity fundraiser on a donor’s later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity, based on an individual’s decision to relist (versus hold) the purchased charity {NFTs} (a sign of strategic generosity), and based on an individual’s degree of social exposure within the {NFT} marketplace. We show that charity-{NFT} ‘relisters’ experience significant penalties in the market, in terms of the prices they are able to command on other {NFT} listings, particularly among those who relist quickly and those who are more socially exposed. Our study underscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more broadly.},

	abstract = {Following Bitcoin’s Nakamoto Consensus protocol ({NC}), hundreds of cryptocurrencies utilize proofs of work ({PoW}) to maintain their ledgers. However, research shows that {NC} fails to achieve perfect chain quality, allowing malicious miners to alter the public ledger in order to launch several attacks, i.e., selﬁsh mining, double-spending and feather-forking. Some later designs, represented by Ethereum, Bitcoin-{NG}, {DECOR}+, Byzcoin and Publish or Perish, aim to solve the problem by raising the chain quality; other designs, represented by Fruitchains, {DECOR}+ and Subchains, claim to successfully defend against the attacks in the absence of perfect chain quality. As their effectiveness remains self-claimed, the community is divided on whether a secure {PoW} protocol is possible. In order to resolve this ambiguity and to lay down the foundation of a common body of knowledge, this paper introduces a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively analyze {PoW} protocols’ chain quality and attack resistance. Subsequently we use this framework to evaluate the security of these improved designs through Markov decision processes. We conclude that to date, no {PoW} protocol achieves ideal chain quality or is resistant against all three attacks. We attribute existing {PoW} protocols’ imperfect chain quality to their unrealistic security assumptions, and their unsatisfactory attack resistance to a dilemma between “rewarding the bad” and “punishing the good”. Moreover, our analysis reveals various new protocol-speciﬁc attack strategies. Based on our analysis, we propose future directions toward more secure {PoW} protocols and indicate several common pitfalls in {PoW} security analyses.},
